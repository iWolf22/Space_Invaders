# Space Invaders Pygame README

This is a Space Invaders game I made when I was younger, just thought I would upload it to GitHub if anyone would like to check it out!

Note, if you are trying to download and run the game, your going to need to install Python and Pygame then your going to have to run "Pygame_Space_Invaders.py"

I hope you enjoy the game!
